## Dependencies

- Node >= 12.0.0
- npm >= 6.0.0

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Testing

Tests are split in three test suites.
Each one tests a separate piece of functionality.
To run tests use the `npm test` command.

## To-do list

1. Create a branch from master named with your first & last name (e.g. ivan-ivanov)
1. In `src/calculator.ts` implement `calc`, `getCurrentValue` and any other methods you need in order to make the tests pass.
1. Commit the solution once you're done or the time is over.

## Evaluation

These are the things which will be evaluated ordered by importance:

1. Number of green test suites
1. Number of green tests
1. Code redundancy
1. Code maintainability
