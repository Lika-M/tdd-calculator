## Dependencies

- Node >= 12.0.0
- npm >= 6.0.0

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Testing

Tests are split in three test suites.
Each one tests a separate piece of functionality.
To run tests use the `npm test` command.

## To-do list

1. Create a branch from master named with your first & last name (e.g. `git checkout -b ivan-ivanov master`)
1. In `src/calculator.ts` implement `calc`, `getCurrentValue` and any other methods you need in order to make the tests pass.
1. Make sure you to commit & push after every completed task (e.g. `git commit -m "task1 completed"` & `git push -u origin ivan-ivanov`)
1. After you're done with the task or the time is up, do one final commit.

## Evaluation

These are the things which will be evaluated ordered by importance:

1. Number of green test suites
1. Number of green tests
1. Code redundancy
1. Code maintainability
